# Olympic Data Analysis ETL Pipeline using Azure Services

This project showcases a comprehensive End-to-End Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline designed for the analysis of Olympics data. Leveraging Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Power BI, this solution provides a seamless and scalable approach to transforming raw Olympic data into actionable insights.

#Project Phases:

Data Extraction from GitHub:

Raw Olympic data is sourced directly from a GitHub repository, which serves as the central location for diverse datasets related to coaches, gender entries, medals, and teams.
Data Loading into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2):

Azure Data Factory orchestrates the extraction process and loads the raw data into ADLS Gen2, a scalable and secure storage solution.
Data Transformation using Azure Databricks:

Leveraging Azure Databricks, the raw Olympic data is transformed into a structured and analyzable format.
Databricks notebooks are utilized for data cleaning, feature engineering, and any required data manipulations.
Storage of Transformed Data in Data Lake:

The transformed data is stored in ADLS Gen2, allowing for optimized storage and retrieval in Parquet or other efficient formats.
Integration with Azure Synapse Analytics:

Azure Synapse Analytics is employed for advanced analytics and warehousing capabilities.
Synapse pipelines are designed to ingest data from ADLS Gen2, perform further transformations, and enable data exploration and analysis.
Data Analysis and Visualization using Power BI:

Data analysts leverage Power BI to connect to Azure Synapse Analytics, creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
Power BI provides an intuitive interface for exploring and understanding the Olympic data, empowering the data analysis team to derive meaningful insights.
Key Technologies Used:

Azure Data Factory: For orchestrating and automating ETL workflows, facilitating data extraction and loading into ADLS Gen2.
Azure Databricks: For data transformation, cleaning, and exploration.
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: For scalable and secure storage of both raw and transformed data.
Azure Synapse Analytics: For advanced analytics, warehousing, and efficient data processing.
Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations, enabling data analysts to derive actionable insights.
Project Outcome:
This project demonstrates the power and versatility of Azure services in creating a robust ETL pipeline for Olympics data analysis. By seamlessly integrating Azure Data Factory, Databricks, ADLS Gen2, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI, the solution provides a streamlined workflow from raw data extraction to insightful visualizations. The portfolio showcases the ability to leverage cloud-based services for end-to-end data solutions, catering to the dynamic needs of data analysts and decision-makers.
